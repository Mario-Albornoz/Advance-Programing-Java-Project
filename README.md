# Advance-Programing-Java-Project
This is a university project done for an Advance Programing Course, where the objective was to demostrate OOP. 

I decide to make a simple Pacman game with an added feature, where after eating enough of the little pebbles (food) the walls shift and start moving. At that point in time if the player touches the wall it will immediatly be game over. 

The objective of the game is to clear two phases. 

1. Normal Pacman
   Here the player only has to complete the level and eat all the foods around the map, they can also eat the cherries to receive a power     up which will allow them to eat the ghosts. The player also has three lives to pass this phase.
3. Chasing walls Pacman
   In this second and final phase the objective is to eat all the cherries across the map while avoiding the moving walls. Here the 
   difficulty increases since if the walls hit the player, then it will be instant game over, regardless of how many lives they had left.



How to Run thi program:
There are no dependencies neede to run this Java programs since all the libraries used are pre-built into Java
To run it you can simply clone this repository and run the program. (Note: Make sure to have the image folder also installed in the right directory to avoid issues)
